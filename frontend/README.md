using React + Vite, aiming for a design similar to CoinStats. Here's a comprehensive plan:

Project Setup:
Initialize a new Vite project with React and TypeScript
Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
Configure absolute imports for better module resolution
Design System:
Choose a UI library (e.g., Material-UI or Chakra UI)
Create a theme file for consistent colors, typography, and spacing
Develop reusable components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
State Management:
Implement Redux Toolkit for global state management
Set up RTK Query for API calls and caching
Routing:
Use React Router for navigation
Implement protected routes for authenticated sections
Authentication:
Create login and signup pages
Implement JWT token storage and refresh mechanism
Add logout functionality
Layout:
Design a responsive layout with a sidebar for navigation
Create a header with user info and quick actions
Main Pages:
a. Dashboard:
Overview of total portfolio value
Quick view of top assets
Performance charts
Recent transactions
b. Portfolio:
Detailed list of user's assets
Add/remove assets functionality
Portfolio allocation chart
Performance metrics
c. Markets:
List of top cryptocurrencies
Search and filter functionality
Price charts for each asset
d. Transactions:
Transaction history
Add new transaction form
e. News:
Curated news feed
Filtering by categories
f. AI Insights:
Portfolio analysis
Market insights
News analysis
Features:
Real-time price updates using WebSockets
Interactive charts (consider using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js)
Drag-and-drop functionality for portfolio management
Dark/light mode toggle
Performance Optimization:
Implement lazy loading for routes
Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations
Optimize images and assets
Testing:
Set up Jest and React Testing Library

11. Error Handling:
Create error boundaries
Implement toast notifications for user feedback
Internationalization:
Set up i18next for multi-language support
Progressive Web App (PWA):
Configure service workers
Add offline functionality
Documentation:
Write component documentation using Storybook
Create a README with setup instructions
Deployment:
Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)
Configure deployment to a hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify)
